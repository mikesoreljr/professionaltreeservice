            <li><strong>Company History:</strong> In 2005 my friend's stepdad was a stump grinder and he had me work with his associate who ran a tree service.  Not a month in working for him I went to ground zero of New Orleans to help with the Katrina Cleanup Efforts.</li>

    <div id="market-analysis" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Industry Overview:</strong> Bill $800-1,000 per hour all inclusive debris removal fees.  Wood dumps are not as far as the regular dump, seperate dump.  Chippers rent for $450 a day.  Many competent workers & current businesses willing to subcontract.  New technologies like tracked bucket lifts can fit thru gates and go up to 60-70 foot so making quick work of large trees has never been easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Target Market:</strong> Detailed description of your ideal customers, including demographics and buying behavior.  Homeowners within the Markham Woods Road Corridor, Sweetwater, Apopka, & Windermere/Dr. Phillips, even Mount Dora/Sorrento areas.  Ideal customers live in non-gated communities with no HOA's.  Houses with mature trees, big yards to fit machinery within.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Needs:</strong> They need licenses & insurances, a superior service for a fair price, talented workers, professional appearances.  We support local barbecue businesses by supplying them with firewood.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Trends:</strong> Ai, will remove many office labor jobs, so the demand for tree work will remain.  Robots in 10-20 years will be able to climb and remove trees.  Grapple saws on the ends of Knucklebooms function as robotic arms currently.  More knucklebooms and bucket lifts will exist making takedowns much safer with high tech equipment.   There are more companies recycling the wood turning it into wood pulp, and people are requesting chip drops (free chips) to use in their yard instead of costly mulch.</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> My 2 competitors are my associates, they charge up to $1,000 per hour and these prices are market rate.  There are cheaper companies that offer a substandard service and undercut the professionals.  There are plenty of trees in Seminole, Lake & Orange Counties.</li>

        <h2>Service or Product Line</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product/Service Description:</strong> I am a one person corporation, that will bill the project @ cost and upcharge a %30 Percent Management Fee.  I will provide the dumpsters for the job, and use subcontractors to load them.  I will have a bobcat to bring to jobs for when a bobcat is needed for large logs.  I will chip brush and take to recycling center, then use the bobcat's splitter attachment to process the firewood and store at my current property.  We focus on many and large oak removals, bringing in a crane subcontractor and always charging full price so we will be able to bring in the proper heavy equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique Selling Proposition (USP):</strong> With professionalism and passion, high spatial IQ and skills, me and my team of subcontractors are uniquely skilled, motivated & dedicated to the art of tree removals/trimming.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Lifecycle:</strong> Most jobs 1-5 trees will take between 3-4 hours.  Unless the trees have hazards or we can't fit bobcats or bucket lifts near the tree, then a job can take closer to 6-8 hours.  We typically do removals, in which it is a one time purchasing event.</li>
            <li><strong>Research and Development (R&D):</strong> Once I prove the business model, I plan to use my business to apply for a property to store/operate equipment, as well as a specially designed knuckleboom hooklift truck to make jobs go quicker, safer which will make our jobs easierw.</li>

    <div id="marketing-sales" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Marketing & Sales</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marketing Strategy:</strong> Your overall marketing approach, including branding and positioning.  Have a professional lawyer designed contract for service.  Have all applicable licenses & insurances.  Have dedicated accountant on the team who can adivse us on pricing rates.  Branding & positioning will be done by professionals, with a heavy focus on word of mouth (because it is so effective).  Positioned as a Reputable & Skilled Local Tree Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Sales Strategy:</strong> Via a professionally designed website.  Using video edited professional sales videos to communicate our value proposition.  I won't personally sell unless the customer insists.  I have salesmen (owners of 2 tree services) who regularly close jobs for $1,000 per hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> We are market leaders in pricing.  Fully insured trucks and workers comp, general liability, we are a full scope, fully equipped and fully licensed & insured professional company.  We run a professional business so we charge professional rates.  10-15 years ago the market rate for tree services was $400-500 per hour but with inflation are more like $800-1,000 per hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising and Promotion:</strong> Methods you will use to promote your business.  Facebook page, asking customers for yelp, google, facebook reviews Online Reviews.  Have the review system set up so we can collect "community approval".  Video Production for promotions on facebook, targeting high income homeowners that are within our sales territory.  Flyers, business cards.  Attending Sales Weekly meetings like BNI (Business Networking International), Jumpstart in Sanford, FL, 1 Million Cups (Orlando), and attend networking events with a professional designed business card with a link to our online sales funnel.</li>
            <li><strong>Sales Forecast:</strong> I have never been fully booked, the winter season is the slow season, but if we became fully booked at $800 per hour in revenue, and worked 50 weeks at 40 hours per week, our revenue would be $1,600,000 per year.  @ $1,000 billable hour ($2,000,000 per year).  This is projected for 1 fully booked crew.  More crews could handle more work.</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="funding-request" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Funding Request</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Funding Requirements:</strong> The amount of funding you need and how it will be used.  Bare minimum would be $50,000, for a f450 4x4 with upfit hooklift arborist & dumpster bodies.  $60,000 for a used bobcat t66 with bucket, root grapple & wood splitting attachments.  Maybe a 16 foot pintle hitch dump trailer with ramps to help haul bobcat.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Funding:</strong> But after we perform steady work, a knuckleboom truck $60,000-80,000 (used) or $180,000 new truck would be added to the fleet.</li>
            <li><strong>Funding Strategy:</strong> Opening a business account at VyStar Credit Union.  Vocational Rehabilitation potentially co-sign or help fund the startup costs.</li>

    <div id="financial-projections" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Financial Projections</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Projected income and expenses over a specific period Let's say $6,000 per day revenue.  Dump fees $1,200-1,800.  Subs get 60%.  I'd charge 20% for sales & 20% for hauling.  40% of $6,000 = $2,400 per day.  Truck, fuel, insurances & my time would be the only expenses to haul the wood & sell the job.  Making $1,200 to 2,000 per day after project fees and before truck, fuel & insurance fees.  Marketing, Legal, Accounting fees are then factored in for the month.  I'd say I could make $1,000 to $1,500 per day after expenses.  But funds would cycle back into the business to purchase more equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> $2,000-3,000 revenue per day.  $800-1,500 costs per day.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> A snapshot of your business's financial position.</li>
            <li><strong>Break-Even Analysis:</strong> Business is profitable from day one on a project basis.  Proceeds will pay for my truck & expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Assumptions:</strong> This is what my competitors are charging to run a fully equipped & insured tree service.</li>
